Redesign Recommendations:
Visual Hierarchy: Since the business is industrial and high-stakes (Oil & Gas), the UI should look robust, professional, and reliable. Use high-quality imagery of the finished control panels and tank farms.
Project Showcase: The "Finished Projects" section currently seems text-heavy. Consider a card-based layout with "Year," "Client," and "Location" badges.
Technical Specs: Ensure there is a dedicated space for technical data sheets or brand logos to build credibility with engineers.
Mobile Responsiveness: Industrial clients often access site info from the field; ensure the navigation to "Products on Stock" is very easy on mobile.
